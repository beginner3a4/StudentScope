This Python project uses machine learning to predict student performance (High, Medium, Low) from AI-Data.csv.

⚙️ Tools Used pandas, numpy: Data handling

matplotlib, seaborn: Graphs & plots

sklearn: ML models & preprocessing

warnings, time: Runtime handling

📊 Features Visualize class distributions (by gender, topic, etc.)

Clean & encode data

Train/test split (70/30)

🤖 Models Used Decision Tree

Random Forest

Perceptron

Logistic Regression

MLP Classifier (Neural Network)

Each model is evaluated and used for prediction.

🔮 Predict New Data Input custom student stats → get predictions from all 5 models.
